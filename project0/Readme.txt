For this project, I created four html pages, which are start.html, about.html, contact.html, and product.html. This project is mainly for a company website. 
You can start with start.html. I implemented the "dynamic picture" with javascript. The image will be changed to the next after 1.5 seconds for each. On this web page, you are going to see three buttons at the top, which are "About us", "Production/Service", and "Contact".
In the About Us page, I mainly implemented "core competencies" and "Our partners and customers". 
You can click on each logo of the partner organizations and you will get a notification of "you are going to leave this website and you are going to another website, are you sure?". I implemented this preventative warning with javascript interacting with users. If you click ok, you will go to the official website of the partner organization. 
If you choose Production/Services, you will be led to this web page telling what the company's production mainly are. 
The last web page is "Contact us", and you can see the phone, email, and address clearly stated in this webpage. 
I already used validations for all three type of languages and all passed the test.
